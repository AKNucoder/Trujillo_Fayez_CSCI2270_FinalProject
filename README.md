# Trujillo_Fayez_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Ahmed Fayez and Josh Trujillo will be working on this project together. Our idea for the project will be mainly using linked lists. What we plan on doing is designing a vacation trip for a pretend family or group of people. Because the trip would already be planned out we are using a linked list instead of a graph because it follows a specific path and each node in our linked list would represent a city to visit along our trip. With this idea of a vacation/trip we have ideas to implement a souvenir system that will take into account a budget/spending money allocated to the pretend family. Then at each city there are certain souvenirs that could be available for purchase and the funds would be taken from the allocated "budget" for the family. Another idea we had was to also implement the idea of gas/fuel for the car. With this idea we thought of having the possibility of checking if they would have enough gas to make it to the next city and if not they would need to purchase gas as well (again probably being taken from that "budget" initially allocated for the trip). Other possible ideas could be having certain foods to try, possibly adding cities along our way to visit, deleting cities if the "family" doesn't want to visit, etc. We are still brain storming for possible ideas but as of now we feel this is a pretty solid start to our project and has quite a few things that we can work on as of now.
